                <div class="textcaption">Roasting coffee</div>
                <p>Coffee roasters are specialized machines that superheat the green beans. Factors such as roast temperature, roast time, and the rate at which temperature rises all affect the final product. The process utilizes the Maillard reaction, commonly known as "caramelization". It's what makes browned butter and roasted food taste so good. Roasts range from light to dark, with most specialty coffee roasters aiming for light - it keeps the largest amount of flavors present in the final product! This is a highly specialized process that requires a lot of skill and a healthy blend of art and science.</p>

                <div class="textcaption">Packaging the product</div>
                <p>Another important step in coffee production is selecting the packaging for your new product. Many roasters choose to use heavy duty plastic bags that help seal in the flavor and prevent oxidation. A newer alternative is PLA, a plastic made from corn, which is industrially compostable. The goal of packaging is to prevent the coffee from being exposed to the three main enemies of freshness: light, heat, and oxygen. It's also a chance to attract attention from potential customers using aesthetically pleasing designs.</p>

                <p>Logistics is an entire job within itself.The post-COVID era has seen a dramatic increase in the amount of online purchasing in the coffee industry, especially for roasters that had were primarily at brick-and-mortar locations. Many have had to adapt to this change quickly or risk becoming irrelevant. Thankfully, the traditional sales channels have returned to normal levels for most, but the era of tailored subscription products, viral popularity, and customer-need-focused pivoting has just begun.</p>

                <p>Cafes: a place for meetings, for friendship, for art. A community fixture and a staple of modern society. It is here, in every city across the world, that you can experience all of the work that has gone into the production of your coffee. While many types of coffee can be made at home, third-wave cafes are equipped with the expertise and expensive equipment to bring out the soul of the coffee.</p>

                <p>There are dozens of methods for preparing the world's favorite (sorta) bean. Many of them are specific to the regions in which coffee is grown, but many of them have been developed by countries that have been importing the product for centuries. The three methods that are common to the United States are pour over, machine drip, and espresso. Pour over is simply boiling water from a kettle poured over fine grounds through a paper filter; machine drip works similarly but the pouring is automatic and made in large batches; espresso is super fine coffee pulled through an espresso machine, a finely tuned beast of machinery that utilizes a boiler and pressure to create a thick and creamy concentrate.</p>
