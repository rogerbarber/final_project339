                <p>Roasters turn the green beans into a finished work of art, while baristas and consumers turn the roasted bean into the myriad of beloved varieties of coffee beverages we love.</p>

                <p>Coffee roasters are specialized machines that superheat the green beans. Factors such as roast temperature, roast time, and the rate at which temperature rises all affect the final product. The process utilizes the Maillard reaction, commonly known as "caramelization". It's what makes browned butter and roasted food taste so good. Roasts range from light to dark, with most specialty coffee roasters aiming for light - it keeps the largest amount of flavors present in the final product! This is a highly specialized process that requires a lot of skill and a healthy blend of art and science.</p>
