                <h1 class="textcaption">Coffee Production</h1>
                <p>The coffee plant has been enjoyed for thousands of years. Methods for growing, harvesting, and processing the coffee cherries, or 'cascara', have been developed meticulously over this long period of time by families and communities. Every region has their own method of achieving the same thing - the raw, unpotentiated "green bean". Coffee was believed to have been first discovered as a medicinal herb in the Middle East and Northern Africa, coming to cultural prominence in Yemen as the drink of scholars. This is a hotly debated subject amongst several countries. </p>

                <p>Coffee beans are actually just the seed of the coffee fruit. The fruit itself has layers: the skin is on the outside, followed by the fruit-flesh called the pulp, under which lays the mucilage. Beneath that lies a thick paper-like layer called the parchment, followed by a softer layer called the silverskin - within that lies the prize, the fabled coffee bean.</p>

                <div class="textcaption">Growing the coffee tree</div>
                <p>The coffee tree is a mid-size flowering bush that produces coffee cherries. The trees are cultivated in fields and harvested by either hand or machine. Shade-grown coffee often fetches a higher price than sun-grown and is thought to produce tastier coffee - and it also takes longer to grow.</p>

                <div class="textcaption">Coffee processing: natural vs. washed</div>
                <p>The most important step after harvest is the processing. Washed processing involves pulping the fruit, taking off as much of the fruit matter (the pulp) as possible before drying the beans in the sun - the "washed" part refers to the thorough rinsing and floating that happens in tanks of water. Natural processing removes only the skin and leaves the rest of the fruit matter on the bean while it dries in the sun. Washed coffees tend to be the more traditional chocolate, nut, and savory notes; natural coffees tend to be sweet, sour, fruity, and fermented. Natural processing is considered the traditional method for processing coffee.</p>

                <div class="textcaption">Making the grade</div>
                <p>The processing determines the final quality of the green bean - factors such as processing time, ripeness when picked, proper care of the plants, and weather during the growing season all play vital roles.Every country has a different grading system for the final products, but they usually follow a letter or number system, with Grade A or 1 being the best. Different grades fetch different prices - most specialty coffee importers will only go for the top two grades, and everything else is left to the large-scale commercial coffee suppliers.</p>

                <p>The last - and most expensive - step in the life of a raw coffee bean is exporting. Usually handled by third parties, coffee is sold to roasters all across the world through various channels. Kept in burlap sacks lined with moisture barriers, they travel thousands of miles on ships to their destinations. The best coffee roasters know to source their beans directly from the farms through established relationships with growers.
