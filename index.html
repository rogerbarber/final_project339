                <h1>What is Coffee?</h1>
                <p>Coffee is the seed of a coffee plant and taken from its fruit; the most common varieties are Arabica and Robusta.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="grid-item arabica_image">

            <div class="grid-item arabica">
                <div class="textcaption">Coffea arabica</div>
                <p>Arabica is considered the high-end and delicious variety that grows in cool, sub-tropical climates and often at higher elevations. It requires tender care over a long period of time. This is the type you want when you buy the "good stuff". Almost everything above generic store-brand coffee is entirely, or mostly, Arabica.</p>

            <div class="grid-item robusta_image">

            <div class="grid-item robusta">
                <div class="textcaption">Coffea robusta</div>
                <p>Robusta, or "canephora", is the hardier relative of the Arabica plant that grows in a much wider variety of climates. It is more bitter, produces more fruit, and has more caffeine per seed than its sub-tropical cousin. This is often used as a "mixer" to make a coffee blend cheaper and more powerful. It is popular in some countries around the world and enjoyed alone.</p>

                <div class="textcaption">What is 'Specialty Coffee'?</div>
                <p>Think back to the "good old days" of black coffee. It was all dark, all pre-ground, and questionably sourced. Specialty coffee is known as the "third wave", being the third age of coffee production and consumption. The focus has shifted from providing a cheap, plentiful, and consistent product to providing coffee that is ethically sourced, lighter roasted, well-grown and of a higher standard. It is more about embracing the methods and coffee culture of the regions the coffee is grown.
